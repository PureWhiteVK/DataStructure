# DataStructure
for data structure recap

## Sort

- [x] 9 basic sort algorithm (inner sort)
  - insert sort (insert sort with binary search)
  - shell sort
  - bubble sort (bidirectional bubble sort)
  - quick sort (with iterative version)
  - select sort
  - heap sort
  - merge sort (with iterative version)
  - radix sort (only support unsigned integer)
  - bucket sort
- [x] advanced sort algorithm (outer sort)
  - multi-way merge sort with loser tree and replacement substite algorithm
- [x] benchmark 
  - stability test
  - near sorted performance test (demostrate quick sort's drawback)

## Tree

- [x] binary tree / general tree 
  - recursive traversal
  - iterative traversal
  - morris traversal

- [x] tree set (all test with std::set<int>)
  - binary search tree
  - AVL tree
  - Red Black tree
  - 23 tree
  - B-tree
  - B+tree

## Graph
- [x] dfs / bfs traversal
- [x] topological sort
